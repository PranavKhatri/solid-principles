# SOLID

**S** : Single Responsibility Principle

**O** : Open/Close Principle

**L** : Liskov Substitution Principle

**I** : Interface Segmented Principle

**D** : Dependency Inversion Principle


Advantage:-

    1. Avoid Duplicate Code
    2. Easy to Maintain
    3. Easy to Understand 
    4. Flexible SOftware
    5. Reduces Complexity

Single Responsibility Principle 
: 

> A class should have only 1 reason to Change.
>> 1. Enhances Readability / Understandable Code
>> 2. Easy to Maintain


---

Open/Closed Principle
: 

> Open for Extension but Closed for Modification

---

Liskov Substitution Principle
: 

> If Class B is a subtype of Class A. then we should be able to replace Object of 
> A with B **"without breaking the behaviour of the program"**.
> > *Subclass should extend the capability of the parent class but not narrow it down.*


---

Interface Segmented Principle
: 

> Interfaces should be such , that client should not implement unnecessary functions they do not need.


---

Dependency Inversion Principle
: 

> Class should depend on the interfaces rather than concrete classes.
